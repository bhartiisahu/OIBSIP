To run the Simplefolio project in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. **Open Visual Studio Code** and use the terminal to navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path_to_your_project_folder
    ```
    Replace `path_to_your_project_folder` with the actual path where your project is located.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    If you haven't already installed the dependencies, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
    After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. **Open the Project in a Browser**:
    Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:1234/
    ```

This will allow you to view and work on the Simplefolio project locally.
